13. Browsers work to render a webpage as a page with content for us as users.  Currently, I use Safari on my iPhone and macbook, but Mozilla Firefox with my schoolwork, as it is the preferred browser at UMT.
Markup languages are how text is displayed in the architecture of a page.  The most common ones are HTML, XHTML, and XML.
